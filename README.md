# Rat-sightings-in-New-York

In the heart of New York City’s urban jungle, the persistent presence of rats has become a defining feature.
Through a meticulous analysis of rat sightings data, a compelling narrative emerges, focusing particularly
on the borough of Brooklyn. The objective is to uncover where and when rats are most prevalent and, more
importantly, why Brooklyn takes the lead in this unsettling urban phenomenon.
Delving into the borough-specific data, Brooklyn consistently emerges as the epicenter of rat sightings. The narrative takes a thought-provoking turn as it aligns with the findings of an investigative article titled “Brooklyn Is the most Rat-Infested Borough, Locals Blame Construction and Gentrification.”(Hallowell, 2019). This
in-depth exploration draws parallels between the ongoing construction projects and the gentrification wave
sweeping across Brooklyn’s neighborhoods.
The article reveals a stark reality.The very development aimed at enhancing urban living inadvertently
disrupts the delicate ecosystem, creating favorable conditions for rat infestations. As new residents flood
into gentrifying areas, the construction boom displaces these resilient creatures, pushing them into the open,
leading to an upsurge in rat sightings. This dual impact of construction and gentrification acts as a catalyst,
making Brooklyn the borough most plagued by rats.
